# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]
- Moved local benchmark specifications, corpora, and run artifacts from the repository root into one ignored `benchmarks/` workspace.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-05
- OpenRouter models can now constrain provider selection through per-model routing settings.
- Model-output protocol failures now use one shared bounded retry policy across analysis, translation, polishing, title translation, language detection, and prescan calls without restarting whole nodes; polishing no longer sends Arabic or Roman index page references to the model, and exhausted polish-item failures preserve the raw translation instead of discarding the batch.
- Resume fingerprints now use persisted run identity languages for translation, polishing, and title-translation nodes, preventing `auto`/detected-language drift from invalidating completed chapters.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-09-04
- Updated the default OpenCode Go Muse Spark Contributor model from 1.2 to 1.3 across runtime configuration, examples, and benchmark metadata.
- OpenCode Go requests now identify Wenyi and include a stable per-run `x-opencode-session` header.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-04
### Fixed

- Locked package metadata now matches release version 1.0.1.
- Repair now short-circuits the current pass after an LLM provider failure, preserving pending issues for the next resume while allowing report and EPUB assembly to continue.
- Fixed XML-incompatible characters in model-generated translations and titles before persistence or publication, including resumed legacy state.
- Source-preserving EPUB publication now accepts unchanged missing footnote backlinks inherited from the input while still rejecting new ones.
- State-backed bilingual EPUB verification now uses schema4 slot evidence and resolves persisted block paths independently of inserted source siblings.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-03
### Changed

- Reorganized pipeline, EPUB assembly, and benchmark packages and mirrored tests by capability; enforced their explicit dependency directions in the architecture gate.
- Deterministic QA now feeds one persisted issue-level Repair queue through the `editor` role, with an independent ten-call budget per issue, resumable ledger state, and guaranteed assembly after exhaustion.
- Reports expose Repair detected/resolved/exhausted counts and logical attempts, always set `requires_user_action: false`, and generate mono/bilingual outputs for exhausted issues.
- Heading segments in balanced/quality translation now use a concise plain-text prompt with source-matching glossary terms and the analyst role, while retaining strict retry/length validation.
- Balanced and quality translation now use one plain-text call per segment; empty or abnormally long responses retry and fail closed, while machine-readable literals bypass translation.
- Balanced/quality prose retries now fall back from an exhausted translator role to the analyst role without relaxing single-segment validation; headings and economy remain unchanged.
- Rich-text EPUB translations are now deterministically distributed by source slot length instead of asking the model to insert boundary markers.
- Targeted retranslation, polishing, and title translation now process one item per request to prevent content swaps in equal-length batch responses.
- EPUB output normalizes malformed source `mimetype` entries to the first uncompressed entry without a trailing newline and allows that metadata-only change through publication verification.
- The benchmark schema now supports minimal/polish clone ablations whose branches share immutable initial translations while recording separate target hashes and usage deltas.
- Added OpenRouter-catalog-verified metadata and a price snapshot for the pinned Tencent Hy-MT2 30B-A3B release, and stopped sending OpenRouter reasoning parameters to non-reasoning models.
- Model routing now exposes explicit `translator`, `analyst`, `editor`, and `fast` roles; Hy-MT2 30B handles plain-text translation by default while Muse Spark Contributor handles analysis, polishing, and fast tasks.
- EPUB translation now deterministically distributes plain-text output back to source slot boundaries.
- EPUB slot state now uses exact source/target values with complete whitespace-tail coverage; target distribution is lossless and schema versions require a fresh run.
- Benchmark candidate schemas now use complete four-role model IDs and compare minimal/polish arms for Hy-MT2 30B, GLM-5.3-Flash, and Muse Spark 1.2 Contributor.
- Benchmark validation now accepts independent translator, analyst, editor, and fast model IDs per candidate.
- Configuration examples now expose independent translator, analyst, editor, and fast model chains.

### Fixed

- The Chinese trillion unit now uses longest-token matching and normalizes to 10^12 without hiding genuine missing-number findings.

- EPUB verification marks each matched source block before resolving later duplicates.
- Reject review autofixes that introduce deterministic lint regressions or remove preserved dialogue quotes.
- Preserve non-linguistic segments without sending them to the LLM, including EPUB text-slot records.

- Direct-`br` bilingual proof now resolves nested inline owners structurally; machine-readable literals bypass polishing and retain exact EPUB slots.
- Added regression coverage for persisted Repair budgets and exhaustion behavior.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-08-28
### Added

- Added a public `editor` model role for independently configuring polishing and naturalization rewrites, inheriting `primary` when omitted.
- Added officially catalogued Alibaba Cloud Model Studio candidate capability metadata and constructor-injected controls for temperature and reasoning.
- Node input fingerprints now reflect the actual model-role combination so model changes invalidate only affected pipeline stages.
- Added optional telemetry for physical `LLM` calls with `JSONL` and collector sinks, plus immutable price snapshots and `Decimal`-based cost quoting.
- Added fully offline benchmark corpus scanning, manual selection, freezing, and validation commands with stable hashes, cross-book quota checks, and leakage detection.
- Added a production-equivalent chapter `EPUB` benchmark whose canary and full modes call `Application.run_all()` directly, isolate state and outputs per candidate and chapter, and require all six `formal` chapters for full runs.
- Added deterministic automated review that samples risk, dialogue, terminology, long sentences, and narrative; blinds every pair among two to six candidates as A/B; splits non-overlapping reviewer shards; and strictly validates coverage and verbatim evidence.
- Added automated review reports covering severity, error types, weighted errors per 10,000 words, per-book results, evidence, production state, and API cost from frozen price snapshots.
- EPUB source runs now persist schema-4 lxml text-slot contracts and write translations back to reopened source XHTML while preserving inline structure, resources, and vertical layout.
- EPUB exports now pass independent on-disk reopen verification, emit deterministic `epub_verification.json` reports, and publish atomically while preserving existing files and stable events on failure.
- Schema-4 bilingual EPUB publication now renders each lxml resource once using shared source cleanup, container/direct-`<br>` pairing, and bilingual style contracts; it supports `target_first` and `source_first` and rejects mapping or preserved-marker conflicts before publication.

### Changed

- The `balanced` and `quality` presets now always polish output; `economy` remains unpolished.
- Benchmark candidates must explicitly configure `editor_model`; attribution, shared preparation, the unpolished control, manual evaluation packs, post-edit timing, labor cost, and repricing paths were removed.
- The production benchmark provider moved from Alibaba Cloud Model Studio to OpenCode Go, comparing `deepseek-v4-flash`, `muse-spark-1.2-contributor`, and `mimo-v2.5` candidates that each perform translation and polishing, with per-request pricing from the official OpenCode Go rates.
- OpenAI Responses API models now reuse centralized request controls, response parsing, and token usage normalization.
- Removed the legacy template-based source EPUB fallback; source EPUB assembly now accepts only schema 4 slot state.

### Fixed

- Disabled built-in OpenAI SDK retries to avoid stacking them with centralized provider retries; malformed chat responses without `choices` retry as empty responses; strict polishing retries count mismatches with an exact-count constraint before falling back to individual segments; and full benchmarks reject formal EPUBs containing multiple logical chapters before any request.
- Fixed EPUB schema-4 slot insertion, bilingual source pairing, cross-slot punctuation normalization, and footnote marker recognition, with resume and review-statistics coverage for the strict pipeline.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-08-15

### Fixed

- Windows packaging smoke checks now return success after confirming that a missing input fails as expected, preventing the expected nonzero exit code from failing the release workflow.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-15

### Fixed

- Model language-detection failures now preserve the original exception so configuration errors such as missing API keys are reported directly.
- Body translation retries a whole batch and falls back per segment only for model protocol violations; provider and business errors no longer trigger outer duplicate calls or incorrect wrapping.
- Fixed multiplatform executable packaging, which still assumed `translate` created configuration automatically; smoke checks now run `init` explicitly to verify embedded defaults.

### Changed

- Event logs now use schema 2: routine translation, skip, polish, issue, and usage payloads retain only stable SHA-256 summaries and counts; rewrite audits retain before/after values and emit only after body persistence; append failures warn without blocking the pipeline; and redundant full-chapter writes were removed from translation, back matter, naturalization, and review flows.
- Development checks now enable additional Ruff quality rules, require absolute package imports, and reject new relative imports.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-15

### Added

- Code submissions must update `CHANGELOG.md`, enforced by the commit hook and CI.
- Pushing a version tag now creates a GitHub Release using that version's changelog entry as release notes.
- Added Alibaba Cloud Model Studio provider support and reasoning controls for DeepSeek V4 Flash and Qwen 3.7 Flash.

### Changed

- Configuration was reduced to `llm.provider`, `llm.models.primary`, `llm.models.fast`, and `quality`; legacy provider directories, agent routing, and pipeline tuning formats are no longer accepted.
- Missing `config.yaml` now uses built-in OpenCode Go, DeepSeek V4 Flash, and `balanced` defaults without creating a file.
- Added per-run `--quality`, `--source-language`, `--back-matter`, and `--honorifics` overrides.
- The default `primary` and `fast` roles now both use OpenCode Go `deepseek-v4-flash` to reduce long-form translation cost.
- Model specifications now accept an `:<thinking-level>` suffix with `off`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `max`; startup validates each level against provider and model capabilities, with OpenCode Go `deepseek-v4-flash:high` for `primary` and `:off` for `fast` by default.
